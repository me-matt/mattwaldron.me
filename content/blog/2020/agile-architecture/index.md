###The problem

Architecture and design has a more prolonged release and management cycle, fewer guardrails for processes and typically involves delayed feedback.

Evolutionary architecture doesn't cover this particular problem. Designing systems in a way that enables change is not covering the people aspect of this problem. In my experience, architecture teams don't have formalised processes to help guide them on a day-to-day basis in terms of frequent iterations, output and feedback. There doesn't seem to be a reasonable how to for applying agile principles to architecture teams.

###The solution

Agile software architecture practices. Evolutionary architecture provides a good approach for designing systems resilient to change.

Tighter feedback loops ensure architecture teams can frequently correct their designs and make more up-to-date decisions alongside the engineering teams. There is transparency

It's specifically referring to the processes in place that architecture teams can rely on to help guide them on a day-to-day basis in terms of frequent iterations, output and feedback. Tightening the feedback loops ensures architecture teams can frequently correct their designs and make more up-to-date decisions. Most companies I've worked at take a high-level view of the system and kind of know which way they want to go, but the translation to artifacts for engineering teams is less common, replaced instead by frequent sessions where the architecture is explained to engineering teams.

Over time I would like to explore the parallels between these functions and see where the lessons already applied to engineering might also be applied to architecture. Determining the bounds of each process is the key to creating a well-defined process providing autonomy and clear communication between them.

So the transition to architecture left me in a less structured space and exposed to attributes of ADHD whose management, until this point, had been outsourced to process and other people.

I guess this is my first time posting about ADHD. So yeah, that's a thing I recently got diagnosed with. I've been struggling with aspects of this for many years, but just thought this was completely normal. Only in the past 3 have I started learning more about ADHD and relating the qualities I've always taken for granted or had difficult managing. It's very recently I decided to get a clinical diagnosis, which resulted in a strong case, being off the scale for a couple of DSM metrics and me choosing to try medication.
