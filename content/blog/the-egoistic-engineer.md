Finding symptoms of an egoistic person in software engineering might be a signal
that they're highly self-critical. Being self-critical is a critical skill,
but is easily amplified to a paralysing extreme. Not including other
well-defined mental health issues, imposter syndrome is a condition that
strongly shares this quality.

I've never really tried to understand imposter syndrome past having an
explanation for some behaviours that can also be explained through social
anxiety. But it's useful to have a term that can be used to relate to others
with this experience.

It was only really from musing, after briefly reading about the Freudian
theory of the Id, Ego and Superego, I noticed the similarities between
the qualities of someone who is egoic and someone with imposter syndrome.

If you prescribe to it, the ego is the interface conforming a persons basic
needs to the real-world, with all the implicit social contracts signed. If the
Id desires something, the Ego will attempt to provide low cost, likely previously
experienced solutions to satisfy that desire.

An egoic person is someone whose current emotions, thoughts and behaviours focus
on themselves, with autonomous processes creating ideas of themselves first. Though I
haven't really seen mention this may not necessarily be through a positive lens.

Might imposter syndrome be described in a similar way? Thinking about
accomplishments and experience through a very self-critical lens, where the
autonomous processes create ideas of themselves, but in a very negative way that
deflates accomplishments and minimises success.

This might imply that to mitigate imposter syndrome the interface at which the ego
conforms to the real-world requires some change.

I suspect most cases of imposter syndrome occur as a consequence of 
reduced domain knowledge, often occuring when moving from one industry to
another.

A lack of domain knowledge may then be conflated with a persons skill level in
a particular role, when these are indeed very different things. So future
contributions and experience are more likely to be cast through this initial
lens, decreasing the odds of contributions being positively recognised.

A good change to this interface might be to onboard to a domain model prior to
engaging in responsibilities of the role. This is ideally with ubiquitous
language and customer journeys well defined. The familiarity with the domain then
reinforces an understanding of the product. But it won't be done from a position
of decreasing confidence, it will be done alongside an existing internal model
of what that product is doing and why.

I wonder if there might be a use case for cataloguing domain models and defining
ubiquitous language for each, like a library of generic domains. Where a generic
template can be taken and used as a base for companies to customise with their USPs.
