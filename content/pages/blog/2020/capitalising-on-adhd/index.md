###TL;DR
One of the many pervasive ADHD qualities, is enthusiasm. In a workplace setting, this can fairly easily get our of control. But with the help of medication, from my perspective, it can also be harnessed into a high-energy focus on new and interesting ideas, practices and ways of working. But as with everything ADHD, requires careful management.

No-one will deny ADHD can be extremely challenging to manage, but there are some positive qualities. Since starting medication, I've found some of these qualities slightly more amenable to control. In this post I'm going to discuss enthusiasm.

>ADHD people are certainly an enthusiastic bunch.

Under normal conditions, I find it difficult to get excited about things that aren't particularly interesting to me, especially in a work environment. Conversely, things that are interesting become a topic of obsession until I find the next interest. This typically results in hobby cycles in the order of weeks.

That however, changed when I started Rubifen. There have been a few tasks I appreciate the value of, with no intrinsic interest, that I have started and completed. Typically these tasks would only have been met with procrastination and missing key details, but this time I enthusiastically got behind the ideas and even championed them to the rest of the team.

>Without ADHD medication, starting a task is next to impossible unless it's interesting, then it's impossible to put down.

With the existing coping strategies in place and additional assistance of Rubifen, I've found the bar for being enthusiastic about topics to be lower. This has resulted in not just being able to get behind positive ideas and change, but actually putting in the effort on more remedial tasks to see those changes through to completion.
