Obligatory first post!

I wanted to push this version with a first post and so, on the spot, I have decided a good starting point would be a reading list.

Over the Easter weekend, I'm going to make a start on my 2020 reading list. First up, Quantum Mechanics, The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind.

Other books in my reading list for the year include:

- Understanding Analysis, Stephen Abbott
- Clean Architecture, Robert C. Martin
- Strategy, An Introduction to Game Theory, Joel Watson
- Thomas' Calculus
- ADHD and the Edison Gene, Thom Hartman
- Infinite Powers, Steven Strogatz
- University Physics with Modern Physics, Young and Freedman

The intent of this blog is to provide a space for writing about things to reinforce learnings, or for me to explore new ideas.
