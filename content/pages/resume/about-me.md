Hi, I'm Matt. I enjoy thinking about problems, especially really big, important ones. I also enjoy understanding how things work at a very technical level. This lets me look at situations through many lenses.

Professionally, I like challenging problems and finding optimal ways to break them down and solve them.

During my downtime, I am always learning new topics, spending most of my time digesting ideas and folding them back into my own understanding. I'm an advocate of life-long learning and champion practices for positive mental well-being.

The rest of my free time is spent with my friends and family, and enjoying whatever outdoor activities work best for the time, from mountain biking to surfing to snowboarding.
