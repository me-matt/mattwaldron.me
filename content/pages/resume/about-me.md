I enjoy solving problems, especially engineering problems. Understanding how things work is my biggest hobby.

My free time is usually spent with family and friends, and learning as much as possible. Being an external thinker, I like to talk through ideas to help evolve them.

A continuous advocate of life-long learning and mental well-being. Though, I'm also keen on board sports.
