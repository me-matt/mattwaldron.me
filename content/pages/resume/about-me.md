Hi, I'm Matt. I enjoy working through problems and finding the best solutions that seem to fall out of a problem space.

I spend free time with family and friends, and learning, lots of learning. Digesting new ideas and patterns of thinking and applying those to other domains is my biggest hobby.

Being an external thinker, I often talk through ideas with friends to evolve my understanding of the world.

A continuous advocate of life-long learning and mental well-being.

I'm also keen on board sports.
