I have worked professionally in software development for over 15 years in multiple industries. For the past few years this has been in an architectural capacity, from technical to enterprise responsibilities.

I'm a valued individual contributor and an effective leader and team member. I firmly believe that good collaboration is key to success.

Very adaptable and comfortable in recognising and applying both symptomatic and fundamental solutions.

Confidently dialogues with appropriate stakeholders to understand requirements and outline options, conveying their relative merit/cost with a strategic focus.
