Helped define an organisation-wide architecture practice focussed on delivering agile architecture.

Improved the cohesion of the architecture team by delivering multiple organisation-wide transformation programmes involving domain driven design, capability modelling and distributed, async decision-making.

Promoted a consistent mechanism of decision making, reducing overall time to make enterprise- and domain-tier decisions, by coordinating a cultural change for distributed async decision making. This required definition and delivery of architectural products and communicating their use and value throughout the organisation.
