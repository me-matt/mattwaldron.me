Enabled Xero to scale to additional regions and markets, as outlined by the organisations OKRs, by designing a scalable architecture for integrations with 3rd party financial institutions.

Provided autonomy and ownership within my immediate engineering teams, measured by the teams' ability to deliver integrations. I delivered this by defining and communicating a technical strategy for the product group and creating a technical roadmap to achieve this.

Delivered an autonomous culture within the product group enabling ownership by aligning the organisation structure and architecture.

Created alignment in the product group, measurable by the innate knowledge of the organisations architecture vision. This was achieved by helping define and communicating the broader principles, guardrails and architectural decisions across the organisation.

Connected stakeholders throughout the organisation enabling more effective async operations by creating frequent forums for different layers within the organisation to discuss architecture and how the function provides them value.

Uplifted technical capabilities throughout the engineering teams providing greater awareness of the solutions available by coaching engineers, product owners and managers and mentoring engineers within the product group.

Enabled a 'north star' orientation for the team by defining a technical strategy and resulting architecture for the product group.

Improved cohesion within the team, evident through the improved alignment over domain boundaries, by implementing a new operating model with engineering teams and creating new relationships with stakeholders.

Created a visibility of architecture within the team promoting overall architectural dialogue, by facilitating frequent whiteboarding sessions and presenting to the product group.

Helped define an organisation-wide architecture practice function by observing and contributing to systemic issues, moving my role to the architecture practice team.

Contributed to architecture alignment throughout the organisation by delivering multiple organisation-wide transformation programmes involving domain driven design, capability modelling and distributed, async decision-making.

Promoted a consistent mechanism of decision making, reducing overall time to make enterprise- and domain-tier decisions, by coordinating a cultural change for distributed async decision making. This required definition and delivery of architectural products and communicating their use and value throughout the organisation.
